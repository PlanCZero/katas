## Things I'd like to experiment with

- A REAL Functional Language. Probably Haskell and/or F#.
- Go feels worth my time. I'd like to spend time with it a bit more regularly.
- https://github.com/getstream/vg - I strongly prefer workspace based Go dev and this looks to make that easier.
- Make a "dual package" (JavaScript package in CommonJS and ES Modules) by following https://redfin.engineering/node-modules-at-war-why-commonjs-and-es-modules-cant-get-along-9617135eeca1
