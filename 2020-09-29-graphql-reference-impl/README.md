I created this when I first joined the PaaS team and was learning GraphQL.
After going through some basic training on GraphQL, I wanted to build something.
The team is using Apollo so I will do that next, but I thought it would be interesting to build
something simple with the reference implementation first.

Install: `yarn`
Run: `yarn start`
